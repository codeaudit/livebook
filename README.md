#Livebook

Livebook is an [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)-compatible experiment to share your data stories on the web.

It features live coding, realtime collaboration, a WYSIWYG prose editor, and runs 100% in the browser.

##Motivation and audience

We data scientists tell stories with data. This is why the notebook format is so powerful: a mix of explanatory prose, data, and executable code that produces charts and tables.

When we share our notebook with a client, researcher, or other colleague who is not a heavy IPython/Jupyter user, we typically send them static HTML or a PDF. But this doesn't invite them into the story, because they cannot freely tinker with the results without setting up their own Python environment.

By uploading a notebook to Livebook, you can share it with a colleague in a format that allows them to tinker with the code or edit the prose without installing anything. When your colleagues can interact with your data stories, your narrative becomes bidirectional.

_Livebook is an experiment, not for production use. We hope it will demonstrate some ideas and perhaps inform future possibilities for the Jupyter project._ 

##Features

###Live coding

Play around with your code and plots, and get instant results as you type. No need to rerun cells or track cell dependencies.

###Realtime collaboration

Work on your notebooks simultaneously and see your collaborators’ edits on the fly.

###WYSIWYG prose editor
Structure and document your notebooks as if you were writing a regular text file, including easy formatting and highlighting. Your colleagues don’t need to know Markdown to contribute to the notebook.

##Caveats

- developed on Chrome; functionality may be incomplete on other browsers
- currently not supporting full pandas, but a stand-in “fauxpandas” library
- matplotlib shim very incomplete
- no ability to use wider ecosystem of python tools
- can’t use print statements
- CSV file cannot be changed after initial upload
- size of embedded CSV file limited to a few thousand records
